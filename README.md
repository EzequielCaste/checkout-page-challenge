<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

The demo for the solution to this challenge is hosted on GitHub Pages. I used CSS variables, Flexbox, CSS Grid and Media Queries to make the page responsive for Mobile, Tablet and Desktop sizes. I start the page design mobile first and later work on the desktop and tablet sizes.
